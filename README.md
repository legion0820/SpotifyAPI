# final-project-group-18-final-project
Project is implemented using the Assignment-3 template provided by Professor Hess at Oregon State University.<br><br>

*IMPORTANT*<br>
Before running the app, create a local environment file!<br>
This can be done in the terminal window by doing:<br>
"touch .env.local"<br>
Then place the client id, client secret and redirect url in that new file.<br>

*This next portion is done on two separate terminal windows, one to run the app and one for the server.<br>
To run the app:
1) Install dependencies (npm install)
2) Run (npm run dev)

To run server:
1) Run (npm run api)
